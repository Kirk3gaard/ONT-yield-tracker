# ONT-yield-tracker
Community sourced tracking of nanopore yields. Are flowcells getting better?

Recently had several Nanopore PromethION flowcells going beyond 200 Gbp and wondered whether this is a common trend.


 * Report your flowcell yields here: [Google form](https://forms.gle/nmUqXLYKG3DxP3SLA)
 * See the reported values in this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nnnyTM5DiRpobnvqFs0ag48_qqbuEmebVqI_UV5evr8/)

Eventually we can do some plots.
